This project âœ…use React to build a survey form. âœ…The completed project consist of at least 3 questions that need to be answered by users. âœ…When the user presses submit, they see a summary of their answers.

## The built and challanges 

-This week I created a movie picker robot ðŸŽ¬
- The survey consist of  3 questions.
-  One question consist of radio buttons.
-  One question is a select dropdown.
-  One is a name input field
- There is a submit button. When pressed the app hides the input form and show a  summary of the user's submissions.
- The site should follow accessibility guidelines for screen readers
- Validation was added to the survey

The challange was to using state hooks to pass information between the components. So that the infomration renders in the right place. Furhter to structre the component in such a way that they can be resuable. I used my team mates for help, stack overflow and a lot of google-ing to overcome this.
